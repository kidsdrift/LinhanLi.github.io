						<p>It was created by 6 members, including a product manager, two game designers, a FX artist, and two programmers.</br> My responsibilities included designing mechanics and puzzles, producing art assets, writing the script, and programming.
						</p>
						<h3></br>As Paper is the pillar of the game, </h3>
							<p>Collage was identified as the dominant art style, levels were designed to fold like paper, and paper items were used to convey a story.</p>

						<h2>How to play</h2>
						<ul>
							<div class="col-4"><span class="image right"><img src="images/ezgif-2-20d4ec8648.gif" alt="" /></span></div>
							<li>At narrative levels, the story is developed through interaction with key elements.</li>
							
							<li>At puzzle levels, the player <b>folds</b> levels like pieces of paper in order to find an accessible path.</li>
							<li>Compatible features are introduced as the puzzles get tougher. For example, there are holes through which the character can pass.</li>
						</ul>
					    </br>
						<h2>About the story</h2>
						<p>The script was adapted from a short supernatural novel written in the Qing dynasty (1740) and an action-romance film of the same name.</p>
						<p>According to the original story, Wang, a Chinese scholar, was infatuated with a fox demon disguised as a beautiful young maiden. They developed a romantic relationship which ended abruptly when Wang discovered her true identity. Finally, a Taoist priest exorcised the fox demon.</p>
						<p>The old myth is subverted thoroughly in our version, where fox demons are depicted as unsophisticated young ladies. They are hunted by a Taoist priest masquerading as an innocent scholar. Once a fox spirit is enchanted by the story in the exorcism book, she will be sealed forever. Therefore, the Taoist priest creates bizarre love stories to entice and subdue demon foxes.</p>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/psp2.png" alt="" /></span>
						<h2>A few other interesting facts</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>Initially, levels were designed on paper prototypes, which programmers refer to when implementing logic in engine.</li>
							<li>Graphic hints are used throughout the levels to aid players in solving puzzles and understanding the story.</li>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/psp3.png" alt="" /></span>
							<li>We didn't have a professional 2D artist. Considering that this is a non-commercial exercise, we downloaded most of the material from <a href="https://en.dpm.org.cn/">offical website of National Palace Museum</a>. In the very first level, relevant masterpieces were listed on a wall.</li>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/psp4.png" alt="" /></span>
							<li>Knowing that reviewers would only spend 5 minutes playing the demo, we used well-known Chinese stories to reduce comprehension costs. As a part of our strategy, we stressed that players will remember our game best if it has a surprising ending.</li>
							<li>In contrast to the original story, which warned about the dangers of beauty from a male standpoint, this rewrite takes a girl's perspective. Love, no matter how romantically depicted in classic literature, sometimes blinds girls.During my childhood, girls were told more romance stories, while boys were told more heroic tales. I was fascinated by ancient folklore about scholars, demons and ghosts in love. The patriarchal ideology embedded in those stories misled me to believe, at one point, that women are supposed to serve their lovers unrequitedly.</li>
						</ol>

						<h2>What I have learned from this project</h2>
							<p>Painted Skin was created under relatively high pressure. The development of the project was hindered by a variety of constraints, including experienced competitors, evaluation methods, and limited resources. Thus, I have honed my resilience and improvisation skills.</br>

								It had a significant influence on the subsequent <i>My life is blocked</i> aesthetically and narratively.
