							<h2>Why I made this game</h2>
							<p>It was inspired by a public debate on whether women's sanitary items should be sold on trains.</br> 
								<i>Weibo</i> - China's most popular microblog website - blocked the tag <i>"Don't be ashamed of menstruation"</i> within days of the discussion taking place.</br>
								On a major Chinese-language website that publishes online novels (<i>JJWXC</i>), there is an even broader range of sensitive words. Language used in everyday life, such as homosexuality, nightclubs, and Tiananmen Square, etc. is replaced with the symbol for "□" due to political issues.</br>
								Despite the legitimacy of censorship, the brutality of such speech control already has a profound impact on the language habits of Internet users. Over time, people tend to forget truth that cannot be discussed, and gradually go from not speaking to not thinking. </p>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/INSB.png"></span>
							<h2>How to play</h2>
							<p> Each puzzle consists of a sentence with a sensitive word blocked out and replaced by "□".</br>
								In order to solve the puzzle, the player must guess what the sensitive word is based on its context and definition.</br>
								Upon filling in the blank, additional details about the sentence will appear, including the symbols that lead to the next level.</br>
							</p>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/bibipGIF1.gif"></span>
							<p>
								There is some form of polysemy in every puzzle. An adjacent pair of words may form a new irrelavant word when the last part of the first and the first part of the second are combined.</br>
								It is not uncommon for real-life conversations on the web to include sentences in the puzzles. In that case, the entire sentence will be erroneously filtered if that new irrelevant word has sensitive meaning.
							</p>
							
							<h2>About the story</h2>
							<p>All of the puzzles and narratives are contained in a worn diary which was found during a thorough cleaning. The contents of the diary are partially hidden for some reason.</p>
							<p>Each page of the diary is revealed as the puzzle is solved. In an unknown era, the diary chronicles the life of a man with train tickets, shopping receipts, employee payrolls, and other vouchers attached. The owner also writes down his thoughts and feelings every day.	</p>
							<p>As recorded in his diary, the man was a sports fan in his university days. He gave up his young love in order to pursue a career in sports journalism. In later years, he changed positions as a censor to earn a higher salary and gain better career opportunities. His discipline increased as the media policy became more restrictive and he became a tool for speech control. Gradually, he abandoned the pursuit of truth and began to violate the basic principles of the profession. In the end, he became so indifferent that he ignored a little girl who had been hit by a car on the road*. He also used his position to block relevant news reports.</p>
							<p>Rather than face the guilt, he chooses to forget, which explains why the diary cannot be displayed in its entirety at the beginning. When the puzzle is solved, the language limitation is removed, which allows the truth and memories to once again come to light.</p>

							<p>In terms of narrative, I was influenced by Lee Chang-dong's Peppermint Candy. The film opens with a suspenseful scene: a crazy man commits suicide at an alumni reunion. Using "peppermint candy" as a clue, the film
								then shows several extremely detailed moments in the man's life, including his first love, family and career. In the end, it turns out that the Gwangju uprising is the cause of his indifference and madness. </p>

							<h2>What I have learned from this project</h2>
							<p><i>My life is blocked</i> was my first independent project and my first attempt to convey my point of view through a game. The project increased my proficiency in Unity2D and provided an exercise in narrative design.</br>
								My original plan was to create simple crossword puzzles with sensitive words. As I conceived further, I added the main story, weaving all the puzzles together. Additionally, I needed to ensure that the characters used in the crossword puzzle appeared in other narrative material. The narrative design was therefore more challenging than the puzzles themselves. Consequently, the number of puzzles in the final game was significantly reduced from what I had originally planned.</br>
								Since the player's ultimate goal was to solve the puzzles, I found that the narrative received relatively less attention during the play test. Many of the facts that needed to be deduced from the narrative material were rarely noticed. For example, only two players realized that the time on the shopping receipt indicated that the protagonist was present at the crime scene. In light of this, I realized that narrative and gameplay need to be integrated closer together.</br>
